# Cybersecurity courses
I heard so many times that the first thing you have to do as a beginner is to know how to use Google. This is half true. I agree with it because if you donâ€™t have curiosity to search for things, and you want everyone to give you the answer for your problem, cybersecurity is not for you. However, if you are starting your cybersecurity journey, you might not know where to start and what to google. 
I know how difficult it is to find valuable content on the Internet on your own. Therefore, below you will find places I have checked, where you can expand your knowledge with the certainty that you will not be misled.

#### Base for Ethical Hacking: 
- Windows
- Linux (Preferably Kali/Parrot) 
- Networking (OSI Model, Protocols, etc.) 
- Scripting skills (Python, Bash, etc.) 
- Solid hacking methodology (recon, scan, gaining access, etc.)
- Tool familiarity (Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nessus, etc.) 

#### Preferred: 
- Active Directory 
- Wireless Attacks 
- OWASP Top 10 
- Coding skills (Python, Bash, etc.)
